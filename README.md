This project was developed as a requirement of Artificial Intelligence course in AUEB Informatics department. It's a basic implemantation of the Othello board game where CPU player uses Minimax AI algorithm to choose what move to play

In order to run our program, all .java files must be compiled. You can either import them into any IDE enviroment of your choice, following its compilation and running guidelines, or execute the javac command from your Windows Command Promt after first you have chosen the correct directory that contains the files' folder (cd path/3180141_3180150/src -> javac *.java). Then just run the Othello file which contains the main method (java Othello) and follow the instructions on your screen.

In the pdf report (Greek only!) you can find an extensive description of the implemented classes and their methods.
